### Why
Hiilarit will make it faster and easier to calculate carbohydrates of a upcoming meal.
This app is aimed for diabetics who have to calculate the amount of carbonhydrtaes in each meal in order to adjust insulin.

### How
This app searches for foods from the database maintained by the finnish National Institute of Healt and Welfare (Fineli).
Data will be accessed with Fineli API (https://fineli.fi/fineli/fi/ohje/19).
User can add food type and weight to the list and the list will calculate the total carbohydrates with the help of Fineli data.

### When
Im workig on this project meanwhile working and studying.
